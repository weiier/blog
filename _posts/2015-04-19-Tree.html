title: algorithms about tree (I)
categories: start

<p>Tree is an important data structure, especially the binary tree. The definition of binary tree is recursive,so we can solve most questions about binary tree using recursive thoughts. Today I will show some easy algorithms about binary tree.</p>
<p>We use java programming language and the binary tree node defined as follows:</p>
{% hightlight java %}
/**
 * Definition for binary tree
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
{% endhightlight%}
