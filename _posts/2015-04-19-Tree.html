title: Algorithms about tree (I)
categories: leetcode
---
<p>Tree is an important data structure, especially the binary tree. The definition of binary tree is recursive,so we can solve most questions about binary tree using recursive thoughts. Today I will show some easy algorithms about binary tree.</p>
<p>We use javascript programming language and the binary tree node defined as follows:</p>
{% highlight java %}
/**
 * Definition for binary tree
 * function TreeNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.left = this.right = null;
 * }
 */
{% endhighlight%}
<h2>Maximum Depth of Binary Tree </h2>
<p>Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.</p>
<p>Recursive Solution:</p>
<p>(1)if the binary tree is null, return 0</p>
<p>(2)else return max(the_depth_of_left_child, the_depth_of_right_child )+1</p>
{% highlight js %}
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @returns {number}
 */
var maxDepth = function(root) {
    if(root == null) return 0;
    var left = maxDepth(root.left);
    var right = maxDepth(root.right);
    return left>right? (left+1):(right+1);
};
{% endhighlight%}
<h2>Minimum Depth of Binary Tree</h2>
<p>Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.</p>
<p>Solution:The solution is similar to the above one, but there is one point that we should pay attention to: when the left child or right child is null, we should return the depth of the other child, instead of the minimum depth of them(0,of course).</p>
{% highlight js %}
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @returns {number}
 */
var minDepth = function(root) {
    if(root == null)return 0;
    var left = minDepth(root.left);
    var right =  minDepth(root.right);
    if(left == 0 && right != 0) return right+1;
    if(left != 0 && right == 0) return left+1;
    return left > right ? (right+1):(left+1);
};
{% endhighlight%}
<h2>Same Tree</h2>
<p> Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are equal or not.Two binary trees are considered equal if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value. </p>
<p>Recursive Solution:</p>
<p>(1)if both of them is null ,return true</p>
<p>(2)else if only one of them is null or both is not null but their value is different,return false</p>
<p>(3)if their value are equal, we turn to judge their left child and right child.
{% highlight js %}
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} p
 * @param {TreeNode} q
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
var isSameTree = function(p, q) {
    if(p == null && q == null)return true;
    else if(p == null || q == null || p.val != q.val)return false;
    var resultL = isSameTree(p.left,q.left);
    var resultR = isSameTree(p.right,q.right);
    return (resultL && resultR);
};
